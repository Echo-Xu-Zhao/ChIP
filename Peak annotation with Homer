## Generate bed or peak file as the input file, any file can be used if contains enough information (can be after peakcalling or Deseq)
## extract information from the file in linux
## In BED or peak files, a dot "." can be used successfully with many tools to represent a "NULL" value for strand (this defaults to "+" when used with some tools)
## annotatePeaks.pl in the HOMER package ignore strand information anyway

cut -f1,15,16,17 input.narrowpeak > output                             ## awk, sometimes print out less rows somehow for a big file
awk 'BEGIN{FS="\t"; OFS="\t"}{print $n,"."}' output > output2          ## add one column with "." after all columns in output file, output2 can be used directly for peak annotation


## peak annotation with Homer
annotatePeaks.pl output2 mm10 > UCSC_annotation                        ## Homer use UCSC as default annotation database

##prepare input file as below:
BED files should have at minimum 6 columns (separated by TABs, additional columns will be ignored)
Column1: chromosome
Column2: starting position
Column3: ending position
Column4: Unique Peak ID
Column5: not used
Column6: Strand (+/- or 0/1, where 0="+", 1="-")

## command
findMotifsGenome.pl <peak/BED file> <genome> <output directory> -size # [options]
## Example
findMotifsGenome.pl 282peaks_homer_list.txt mm10 282peak_motif/  -size 200 -p 4 -bits -S 25 -len 8,10,12 -mask -p 4 -oligo -dumpFasta

#1.If there aren't any truly significant motifs when looking at short motifs, it is unlikely that you will find good long motifs either. Once you do find motifs that look promising, try looking for longer motifs.

#### sort the bam file if not with samtools

#### RNAseq, index bam file, which generating a *bam.bai file

samtools index *.sorted.bam

#### Make normalized bigwig files for paird-end sequencing

bamCoverage -b *.sorted.bam -o *.bw --normalizeUsing CPM -p 2 --scaleFactor 1.0008092

### scale factor is based on Deseq2 library size or EdgeR library size
### RPKM is not the standard value known. it is per bin, binsize 1 is 0.001kb.
